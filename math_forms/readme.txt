This folder holds many example forms.

They can be processed from a linux command line as follows:

~/frame/math_forms$ cat CARRY-15.FRM|./frame|iconv --from-code=IBM437 --to-code=UTF-8

 Many of the sample forms were developed using DOS-OS, thus the character set was Code-Page-437 aka CP437, aka IBM437
 To maintain backwards compadibility these forms are kept and used as CP437 forms,
 and the resulting 'frame' output is converted to CTF-8 character set for proper display on modern terminal and web/browser portals.
