|- Determine if the section is tension controlled:                            |
|  - Per ACI section 10.3.4 a beam is considered tension controlled if the    |
|    strain in the extreme tension steel is greater than 0.005.               |
|  - The calculated steel strain in our section is  εt  = 0.03445            |
|    is greater than 0.005 therefore this beam section is tension controlled. |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|- Next, let's determine if the beam section satisfies the minimum steel      |
|  requirements of ACI:                                                       |
|  - Per ACI section 10.5.1, the minimum steel requirement is:                |
|    As, min = ((3 x sqrt(f'c))/fy) x bw x d   ≥  (200/fy) x bw x d         |
|  - note: the  σ_min=200/fy = 0.0033 minimum controls when f'c < 4500 psi   |
|                                                                             |
|  - Ast_min = ((3*sqrt(f'c))/fy) * b * d   =   1.01 sq.in.                   |
|  - Area of main reinforcement steel:  Ast =   1.33 sq.in.                   |
|  - Ast > Ast_min, therefore we satisfy the ACI minimum steel requirements.  |

|- Finally, let's calculate the nominal moment capacity of the section:       |
|  Using moment equilibrium, we can calculate the moment capacity by taking   |
|  the moment about the center of the tensile force, or the center of the     |
|  compressive force.                                                         |
