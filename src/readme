'Frame' is compiled on a Linux host using Free Pascal Compiler (FPC) or GNU Pascal Compiler (GPC)

The file: c builds the 'frame' executable.

Sample forms are located in the folder: /math_forms
Theses forms can be 'framed' or executed using the command line:

   $ cat CARRY-15.FRM|./frame|iconv --from-code=IBM437 --to-code=UTF-8

--- AGAIN i.e.---
Folder /math_forms holds many example forms having file extension .FRM or .frm

They can be processed from a linux command line as follows:

~/frame/math_forms$ cat CARRY-15.FRM|./frame|iconv --from-code=IBM437 --to-code=UTF-8

Many of the sample forms were developed using DOS-OS, thus the character set was Code-Page-437 aka CP437, aka IBM437
To maintain backwards compadibility these forms are kept and used as CP437 forms,
and the resulting 'frame' output is converted to UTF-8 character set for proper display on modern terminal and web/browser portals.
 
**** To edit one of these *.FRM files having CP437 coding hosted on a Linux OS, 
   I find the fastest, easiest and best was, is to login to the host using PuTTY with setting:
      PuTTY: window -> Translation -> Remote Character Set -> CP437
      then use your favorite editor, such as vim, nano or mcedit.
